{"name":"Hangman","tagline":"Web-based version of the classic paper/pencil game","body":"# Hangman\r\n\r\nHangman is an online game based on the word-game typically played with paper/pencil. Here's the gist of the game, in case you've been living under a rock somewhere:\r\n\r\n  - Goal is to guess the word before full stick figure is drawn\r\n  - CPU selects a random word (3-6 characters in length)\r\n  - You try to guess the word by typing a letter at a time\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n1.1.0\r\n\r\n### Tech\r\n\r\nHangman uses a few open source projects to work properly:\r\n\r\n* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps\r\n* [jQuery] - does stuff\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nYou need TypeScript installed globally:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm i -g typescript\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone [git-repo-url] hangman\r\n$ cd hangman\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce typesript is installed, you can compile the typescript file and output a JS file by doing so:\r\n```\r\n$ tsc hangman.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen index.html in a browser\r\n\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n - Show word after you lose a game\r\n - Refactor to use [AngularJS]\r\n - Add Code Comments\r\n - Write Tests\r\n - Implement Gulp to speed up development (watch will update your page automagically after making a change)\r\n - Multi-player (perhaps via firebase)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n----\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n\r\n\r\n**Free Software, w00t!**\r\n\r\n[//]: # (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job.
